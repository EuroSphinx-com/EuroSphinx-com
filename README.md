- 👀 I’m interested in AI, IT security, Linux Mint support, automotive industry topics, website creation, ...
- 🌱 I’m currently learning more about the functions and options of a firewall in an Linux environment and how to improve my own website www.EuroSphinx.com.
- 💞️ I’m looking to collaborate on IT security in all aspects, but with a special focus on Linux systems on debian basis like Ubuntu/XUbuntu/Linux Mint.

- ⚡ Fun fact: I'm a business engineer (UoAS) from southern Bavaria, but also managed to get an MBA in Growth Mangement +Quality-Manager +PMP from PMI (USA), thus be careful what you write ;-)
